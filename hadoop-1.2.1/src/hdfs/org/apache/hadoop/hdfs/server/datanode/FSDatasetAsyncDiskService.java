/*
 * This class is a container of multiple thread pools, each for a volume,
 * so that we can schedule async disk operations easily.
 * 
 * Examples of async disk operations are deletion of block files in FSDataset.
 * We don't want to create a new thread for each of the deletion request, and
 * we don't want to do all deletions in the heartbeat thread since deletion
 * can be slow, and we don't want to use a single thread pool because that
 * is inefficient when we have more than 1 volume.  AsyncDiskService is the
 * solution for these.
 * 
 * This class is used inside FSDataset.
 * 
 * In the future, we should extract AsyncDiskService and put it into common.
 * The FSDataset-specific logic should reside here.
